# Unity-Scene-Project

I tried to make my project/scene look like a combiniation of a bedroom and a living room. I put in objects that you might normally see inside these two rooms such as a bed or a desktop, but a list will be provided on what is in the room down below. The bedroom side of the project was somewhat inspired by my living room such as the bed being near the computer and a table near my bed as well. The main character of this project is the wine bottle that is ontop of the wine cabinet.
